                            <p> In week 10, we are learning about embedded programming using Arduino IDE. Arduino IDE can be
                                refered as simplified verision of C++ programming language. It construct in Sequencing, 
                                Selection and Iteration. Selection in terms of determines which path a program takes when it is running.
                                Sequencing in terms of the order in which instructions occurs and are being processed. Iteration in terms of
                                Repeated execution of a section of the code when the program is running.

                <h1>Blink an external LED light</h1>
                <p> We were supposed to do exercise 13 on how to use the arduino
                    and trying to make the LED light to light up. In the exercise,
                    we uses jumper wire, resistor thats set on 220 ohm. When clicking
                    onto the simulation, it allows the LED to light up accordingly.

                    wire up, we connect the jumper wire on the beadboard, adding a LED display,
                    resitor and a power supply for the LED display to work.

                    using no power supply, we were told to do 7 segment LED Display countdown timer.
                    Moreover, we need to program the timer from '0 to 9' continuously.

                                the code is link to the devices in order for it to work. When I tried
                                using thinkercad, it was alright but the coding part, i have yet to master it. It took awhile for me to
                                understand where is the mistakes and identify the problem faced. There were lots of devices and 'formula' steps I 
                                have to take note.

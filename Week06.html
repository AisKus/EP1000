                            <p> In week 06, we were introduce to 2D Laser Cutting. In the first exercise of the week,
                                we are told to do a nametag based on the reference given and use our own name. The process took
                                quite fast as compared to designing other object, as we need to just extrude the 'text' and the
                                border of the nametag.

                <p> These are my sketches and draft before I start on doing the laser cutting. In the
                    sketches, I decided to make a 'poker card drawer box'. Basically, it consists of one drawer 
                    where the user can open it and stored their cards or game card and a cover to store. Based on the sketches, you can see that
                    this are the dimension for each boxes and since the plywood material height is 3mm. I decided
                    to measure it -/+ 3mm so that there is some space for the user to pull and close the drawer. The right side picture,
                    is produced on adobe illustrator for the laser cutting process.

                <p> This are the top view of the 'poker card drawer box'. As you can see the box are quite simple which just shows
                    the symbols of 4 different poker elements. I've decided to do engrave and cut  for the top  part  to look
                    like it has a hidden meaning and a way to peek what is inside the box.

                <p> This are the front view, where you can see how the box functions and are quite straightforward
                    as compared to other boxes displayed. Throughout the whole journey of producing this box, there
                    were trial and errors as the inner drawer couldn't fit in or the outer box is just too big for
                    the inner drawer. Despite that, I managed to laser cut my ideas and assemble each parts perfectly.

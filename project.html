                            <p> For the Final Project, we were tasked to build a product and apply
                                our knowledge that we learnt about the basics of arduino uno during
                                the lesson. Based on the previous week where we ideate our product,
                                we are supposed to build on and develop it for the final project.

                <p> As a recap, on week 11, I have included my starts of
                    ideation which showed my Moodboard. My vision of the
                    final project is to create an LED Display which is controlled 
                    by smartphone. However, I have decided to changed to a text
                    scrolling display controlled by smartphone instead. As shown in
                    the moodbboard, I have included the list of materials that I am using. 

                    The crucial equipment to make the product work are 
                    HC05 bluetooth, 8x8 Matrix MAX7219 and obviously
                    arduino uno r3.

                <p> I assembled the materials together and did a test run on it.
                    This is to ensure the Matrix MAX7219 is working and all the 
                    led light in it is not defected or damaged. So, in the picture
                    you can see that all [8 X 32 led pixels] are working. 

                    I tested using the library led display on arduino ide software
                    and make changes based on the assembled wire I did on the arduino
                    uno R3.

                <p> During the process of coding and piecing the materials
                    together, I encounter a difficulty in which caused the
                    led matrix not turn out the way I wanted it to be. Moreover,
                    suddenly the code didn't work out and I have to check the mistakes.

                    There were too many trial and error which caused me to 
                    get frustrated however, I managed to overcome it. In the
                    Arduino IDE, I used MD parola scrolling to help me guide.
                    As for the app, I used the 'Serial Bluetooth Terminal' so that
                    I can sync my smartphone as a controller to control the text
                    written to the led matrix display.

                    As shown in the picture, the smartphone has to be connected

                    compromised with the balanced top led display matrix.

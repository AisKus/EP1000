                            <p> In week 03, we are taught to do computer-aided design 2D on Fusion360. When I tried
                                using Fusion360, it was too foreign as it was my first time using it. Although it took
                                quite awhile for me to get use to it, I managed to sketch out the assignment shown above.
                                I uses various shapes, lines as well as as different tools such as 'trim' to help me
                                achieved the outcome.

                <p> Based on the sketches, I marked each sides length accordingly using ''. The 
                    measurement is followed according to the brief. When doing this sketches, there
                    were times, I get frustrated as the circle doesn't centered the way I wanted it 
                    to be. However, I managed to accomplish it after many fails and error.

                <p> For the next class exercise, we were given a time to recreate the hammer by sketching it out first
                    then extrude into 3D version. So, first of all, I had to sketch out according to the picture using 
                    circle, rectangle for the body shape and pentagon and hexagon for inner part. Afterwards, by clicking
                    'extrude' under solid surface, enable the sketches come alive in 3D mode.

                <p> As for this assignment, we tried out a software called GIMP to venture
                    converting raster graphics into vector. Although, I am not used to using 
                    GIMP, it has a similar and familiar way of using the tools like those in 
                    Adobe Illustrater which is what I'm proficient in. 

                    I traced out the pictures perimeter using a pen tool, coloured the parts.

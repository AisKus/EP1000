                            <p> In week 02, we had an online classes. We learn about what software or channel is
                                being use in web Documentation. In web Documentation, we use Github which is a 
                                provider for internet hosting software development to publish our website. Github
                                enable us to edit on the pages, store our files in the repository and allow easier 
                                accessibility to host our website for free.

                                In any incident of deleted file can be retrieve through git log. As for github desktop,
                                we can easily sync to our repository. It is where we can decide to commit or push. Moreover
                                we can see our progress status and history of our last changes.

                <p> For our first assignment, we needed to create a website with cover fully designed,
                    publish on github, file organised and stored in githubrepository. We have to make
                    sure that it is working as some error might occur when we transport our files into 
                    the github repository.

                <p> This is how my coding are seen on my VS Code. I organised my file into categorisation such as img for images and cssfile for css.
                    This is to make sure that everything is clear as possible and easier to identify problems. I also use division to categorised each coloumn
                    so that it doesn't mixed up. By using various formula enable me to structure my website in a clean way possible.

                            <p> In week 05, we are taught to do computer-aided design 3D printing process on Fusion360. 
                                In this section shows the assignment I did which is chess and handphone holder. This page will
                                tell you more on the process from ideation to final outcomes of the product.

                    This way, it allow me to use the revolve tools so that I can get a nice and smooth outcome of the 
                    edges and make it symmetrical. After revolving, it will turn into a one round chess.

                    a picture of a chess taken from the website and used it as a references. Afterwards, I tried
                    to scale up to match with the dimension given on the exercise which is 30mm [width] by 50mm [height].

                    shell tool. The shell tool is being use at the bottom base of the chess to make a hollow inner. 
                    The final outcome looks exactly like the 3D model in fusion360 with the height of 30mm by 50mm.

                <p> During process of ideating and brainstorm, I came across an idea to make a handphone holder that
                    looks like a cat sillhoutte from the back when the user are using the product. This allow an opportunity
                    to enhance the product aesthestic as well as the practicability part. In the sketch, there is 'stopper' that
                    a way for the phone be placed at a certain angle and lean on the cat sillhoutte which attached to the base.

                <p> When doing the design in the Fusion360, since I have two parts that needed to attached together,
                    I decided to use 'fillet' tool for the cat sillhoutte so that it doesn't feel sharp on the edges.
                    Afterwards, I just have to assembled on the base with an angle of 45 degree facing backwards towards
                    the stopper.

                    CREALITY to 3D print my handphone holder. In the softwarae, I will be using an infill of 20 percent 
                    with the support mode on for the cat sillhoutte. The total time based on the slicing is 5 hours 51
                    minutes. After confirming, I transfer the format from stl to gcode for the 3D print to register the design
                    and will be on the production stage.

                    The holes can be a way for the user to put their pen as a pen holder or even to organised charging wires.
                    As of the front view, it is place to put yr phone where you can watch or scroll tiktok. Phones can be place
                    horizontally or vertically depending on the users preferances.

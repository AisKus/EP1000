                            <p> In week 01, we were introduced on what we learn in the module. In the
                                module, we will learn Web Documentation using Github, Vscode etc. Throughout
                                the module, we get to learn 3D printing, laser cutting and programming. In the end 
                                of the day we were told to complete our Safety lesson, laser cutting and
                                3D Printing to achieve certificate. With that, we can use the facilities to
                                work on our assignment and final project. Since, I already achieved a 
                                certificate for both, I just need to refresh my memory and start on 
                                installing and register software for web Documentation.</p>

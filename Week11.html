                            <p> In week 11, we are taught to about Design Thinking and the tools or framework
                                we can use to ideate our ideas on our FINAL project. There are various framework such as SPS
                                Fragmework which is a method where we conduct design research and analysis based on the existing products.

                <p> These are my moodboard and inspo of what i want imagine and something I would
                    like to do for the final project. My idea was to create a project where different pixel artwork
                    can be shown on the 8x8 matrix Led MAX7219 and it can be controlled by smartphones by using HC05 
                    bluetooth. As shown above, this are the list of items, I will be using the in the projects. The 
                    list is subjected to changes in the future. As for the outer, I might do 3D printing to produce 
                    the shelter to cover the inner electronics and wires to look more organised.
